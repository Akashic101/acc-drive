      "description": "Optimize your race strategy with our Race Engineer. Get real-time fuel and PSI recommendations and let your teammates set up the perfect pitstop for you.",
      "modalText": "The Race Engineer feature in ACC DRIVE is a sophisticated tool designed to optimize your racing performance through data analysis. <br> <br>Key functionalities include: <br>Live Data Analysis: Monitors live PSI and brake temperatures, offering a dynamic overview of your car's performance. <br>Lap-Specific Data: Provides detailed data for each lap, including average pressures, pressure loss, and brake temperatures (minimum, average, maximum). <br>Session Overview: Displays session status, air/track temperatures, grip level, current weather forecast, and other vital statistics. <br>Car Setup Optimization: All of the above datapoints are available for your teammates as well! ACC DRIVE uses them to give you a custom recommendation for your fuel load, and PSI for your next stint. <br> <br>This works hand-in-hand with our revolutionary Remote Pits feature that allows your teammates to finally set up the perfect pitstop for you so that you don't have to mess about and instead can focus on your racing."

      "description": "Track your tyres and brakes performance accurately. Our app also includes an advanced damage model to keep you informed about your car's condition.",
      "modalText": "This feature offers a more accurate and comprehensive approach to monitoring tyre and brake performance, as well as vehicle damage, compared to the standard in-game Tyre App.  <br> <br>Key functionalities include: <br>Accurate Tyre and Brake Data: Displays real-time data on tyre pressures (PSI), temperatures, wheelslip, and pressure loss. Pressure loss is visually indicated when it happens, alerting you when you just had a pressure loss. <br>Damage Model: Provides a detailed view of the car's damage (where how much of the damage is and to which extent the suspension is broken). <br>Brake Life and Temperatures: Monitors the remaining life percentage of brakes and their current temperatures, crucial for maintaining optimal performance. <br>Weather Prediction: Includes a new weather app that features a countdown to upcoming weather changes, allowing drivers to prepare and adjust their strategy accordingly."

    "feature3": {
      "title": "Yellow Flags",
      "subtitle": "Stay ahead of hazards",
      "description": "Our improved yellow flag system provides warnings way ahead of ACC, giving you crucial seconds to react and avoid collisions.",
      "modalText": "Imagine a scenario where you're driving up the mountain at Mount Panorama and suddenly, the Yellow Flag feature activates. Instead of guessing whether the incident is ahead or behind you, you can immediately tell that there is a car 150m away from you on the very left side, turned 90° and facing towards the middle. Instead of blasting full ahead and collecting the car on the apex, you simply take a wider line and avoid the incident easily, thanks to ACC DRIVE. <br> <br>Key functionalities include: <br>Incident Awareness: The system alerts drivers to various types of incidents, such as cars significantly slower than expected, cars that have spun, or vehicles exiting the pits. <br>Distance and Position Indicators: It displays the distance to the incident and the position and rotation of the incident car(s). Other widgets might also flash yellow to bring more attention to an incident car ahead. <br>Visual Indicators: The interface uses transparency to indicate the proximity of the incident. Cars closer to the driver are shown with less transparency, while those further away are more transparent. <br>Enhanced Safety and Responsiveness: By providing early warnings, often before the game's own system, drivers can prepare for upcoming hazards more effectively, contributing to overall safety and strategic racing."

      "modalText": "Since v4.0 we have the ACC DRIVE Friends System: This feature allows users to add each other as friends, directly send session invites, and manage team assignments instead of doing this via 3rd Party software. <br>Also after completing a lap, your telemetry data is uploaded to a secure server. You can choose to share this data, which then allows you and others to view the quickest laps of the community and compare themselves against your records. <br>Comparing with the best: If you decide to share and receive data you can use the Input HUD (blue reference speed) and the Dashboard (minimum corner speed) to show you how you stack up against the communities best laps."

      "description": "Shows the position and rotation of other cars around you. Can be customized for the distance ahead, behind and next to you.",
      "modalText": "The Radar HUD feature in ACC DRIVE is a pivotal tool for enhancing situational awareness during virtual races. This feature provides a real-time display of the position of other cars relative to your own, significantly enhancing your ability to respond to dynamic race conditions.  <br> <br>Key functionalities include: <br>Car Position Visualization: The radar graphically shows the position of nearby cars, giving you a clear view of the vehicles around you. This includes cars ahead, behind, and beside your vehicle.  <br>Added detail: A very neat addition is that you can also see the exact rotations of the shown cars making it a lot more predictable than the one in-game! (We've also gone through the trouble of measuring out the size of each car so a Alpine is a lot smaller on your Radar than a Bentley.) <br>Customizable Range: You can customize the radar to display cars within a specific distance range, allowing you to adjust based on your preferences and needs."

This feature captures and stores telemetry data from your driving sessions, providing an in-depth analysis of various aspects: <br>Lap Analysis: View detailed data for each lap, including lap times, tyre pressures/temperatures/pressure-loss, brake temperatures and remaining life. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of how different factors affect lap performance and how you can expect these to behave in longer stints. <br>Session Information: Access information about each driving session, such as the date and time, type of tyres used (dry or wet), the car driven, and the type of session (race, qualifying, or practice). <br>Performance Metrics: The feature displays high and average values for each lap, covering aspects like tyre pressure, brake temperatures, and the total pressure loss over a lap. It also includes lap sector details like time, top speed, and average speed. <br> <br>Driving Assistance Data: Gain insights into the amount of traction control (TC) and anti-lock braking system (ABS) interventions during a lap, as well as which driving assists were active. <br>Stint Overview: Telemetry provides an overview of total stint details, including the best lap, the optimal lap (combining the fastest personal sectors), average pace, and stint-specific details like temperature progression."

      "modalText": "Imagine a critical phase in an endurance race: Your teams's lead is diminishing, and Team B is steadily catching up. The strategist of your team, using the ACC DRIVE Spotting Page, notices that Team B's last pit stop was significantly shorter, indicating a possible change in strategy. Armed with this insight, you can adjust your strategy, possibly opting for a shorter refueling stop to maintain the lead as they also didn't change tyres.  <br> <br> <br>The Spotting Page serves as a central hub for race oversight, both for racers and engineers, providing a comprehensive view of the race in progress. Key functionalities include: <br>Race Standings and Driver Information: At a glance, users can access pivotal data including current driver names, car numbers, and current race positions. <br>Timing and Performance Metrics: The page displays critical timing information such as the fastest lap times, last lap times, current improvement on the running lap and stint durations, enabling teams to monitor and analyze performance trends. <br> <br>Pit Stop Data: Insight into pit activities is key. The Spotting Page indicates the number of pit stops made by each driver and their current pit status, essential for understanding competitors' strategies. <br> <br>Use-Cases <br>Strategic Decision-Making: For team strategists, the Spotting Page is invaluable. It helps in planning pit stops, observing competitors' strategies, and making real-time decisions based on comprehensive data. <br>Driver Support and Analysis: Drivers can use this tool for post-race analysis to understand their performance relative to others, identify areas of improvement, and develop strategies for future races. <br>Team Coordination: In endurance events where multiple drivers share a car, the Spotting Page ensures seamless coordination, keeping the entire team updated on race progress and driver performance."
