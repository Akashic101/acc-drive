# ACC DRIVE

This readme.md file provides instructions on how to run the React project locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is included with Node.js installation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the React project. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running. By default, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Stopping the Development Server

To stop the development server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where it is running.

## Additional Scripts

In addition to `npm start`, there are other scripts you can use in the project:

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject`: Ejects the project from Create React App configuration.

## Project Structure

- `public/`: Contains the public assets and the main HTML file.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the React application.
  - `components/`: Stores React components.
  - `App.js`: The main application component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the application.
